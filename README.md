# Projektarbeit

The Goal of this project is to study the impact (influence) of applying a z-normalization or a z-log normalization and to see if there is any benefits in using these transformations for classification tasks (supervised learning).

To do so, we are going to apply the z-normalization and the z-log normalization to the data set, and compare the performances of various classification algorithms when not applying the normalizations, applying the z-normalization and applying the z-log normalization.

The classification algorithms that we will be using are :

* Decision tree
* knn (k=3)
* logistic regression
* Naive Bayes classifier
* Neural Network
* Random forest
* Support vector machines
